# Changelog

## 1.4.7
- Made sure that when the favoriting borders are spawned no child elements of it are copied. This is the same fix AzuAutoStore applied and once Recycle_N_Reclaim also applies it, it fixes seeing borders on items that are no longer favorited.
## 1.4.6
- Fixed a visual glitch with the favoriting borders when using the mod Recycle_N_Reclaim (thanks for the heads up, Azu)
## 1.4.5
- Fixed critical bug when using Adventure Backpacks with 'AllowAreaStackingToNonPhysicalContainers' which deleted other players if you did an area stack/restock close to them (possible since version 1.4.0)
- 'AllowAreaStackingToNonPhysicalContainers' is no longer required to detect Item Drawers
- Added Korean translation, provided by hanawa07
- Added Italian translation, provided by Marcuz08
## 1.4.4
- Fixed trash can not reacting to clicks when using both AzuEPI 1.3 and Jewelcrafting
- Replaced controller key check with a more modern version for better compatibility
- Reenabled controller key hints that were disabled in 1.3.9 as their base game performance has since been improved
## 1.4.3
- Added full compatibility for AzuEPI 1.3 using its API (thank you, Azu!)
- Fixed backwards compatibility for AzuEPI 1.2 due to config type change
## 1.4.2

- Fixed the sort inventory button not respecting the BothButDependingOnContext config setting
- Updated simplified chinese translation, provided by taotao
- Made sure controller key hints don't even get spawned, instead of immediately getting disabled, to not trigger another base game visual bug (which affects other mods that spawn buttons too)
