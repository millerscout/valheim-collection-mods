# Farming

Adds a skill that makes crops grow faster and increases item yield for harvesting crops.

Starting at skill level 20, you can plant and harvest multiple crops at the same time. You can toggle this with a hotkey (default: Left Shift).

Starting at skill level 30, you can see the progress of planted crops.

Starting at skill level 50, it removes the biome requirement for crops you plant.

Also adds a hotkey you can press, to toggle snapping of crops (default: Left CTRL).

Also reduces stamina usage while planting crops by 1% per skill level.

All of this can be configured.

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.
